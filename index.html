    <p>
        My name is Alfredo Fonseca, I am a GDD student at Rochester Intitute of Technology in my first year. I'm from Ejido Hermosillo, Baja California Mexico. I was born in Yuma, Arizona so thanks to that I was given US Citizenship. Since I had US citizenship, my parents decided to enroll me into school in the US. I then spent 8 years of public education crossing between countries everyday to go to school. Thanks to that, I am here at RIT!</p>
    <p>
        Going between countries everyday was hard. It was especially hard because it always involved walking from the border to school and back everyday. The Arizona heat did not make this task any easier. Added to this, I had to learn English  from zero. Thankfully, I had really good teachers that helped me while I was learning. Mexico will always be my true home but the US is also a very important part of my life.
